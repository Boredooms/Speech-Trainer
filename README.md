# Speech Trainer üéôÔ∏è

Welcome to the Speech Trainer! This project is your personal coach for public speaking, helping you improve your delivery and become a more confident and effective communicator.

## What's Inside?

This project uses the magic of the Vosk library for speech recognition to analyze your speech and provide feedback.

## Get Started in a Flash! üöÄ

Ready to become a speaking pro? Here's how to get set up:

1.  **Install the Goods:**

    First, you'll need to install the necessary Python packages. Just run this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Download the Brains:**

    This project needs a couple of "brains" (aka models) to understand you. You'll need to download them from the [Vosk model website](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).

    Grab these two models:
    *   `vosk-model-small-de-zamia-0.3`
    *   `vosk-recasepunc-en-0.22`

    Once you've downloaded them, unzip them and place the folders inside the `Speech` directory.

That's it! You're all set to start training your speech.
